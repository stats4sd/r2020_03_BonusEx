<h2>Overview and data</h2>
<p>In this series of exercises we will use a dataset called <code>ClassicRock</code>, which is a list of every song which was played in June 2014 on the 25 largest “Classic Rock” radio stations in America. You can see this embedded below. The variables within the data are hopefully self explanatory - <code>Title</code>,<code>Artist</code>,<code>Year</code> and <code>TotalPlays</code>. Year indicates the year of release.</p>

<p><em>2.5 Although (or maybe because?) they are my favourite band, I refuse to acknowledge the music of Van Halen after the lead vocalist David Lee Roth left the band in 1985. So I would like to do some comparisons from this data between the amazing original lineup and the terrible replacement lineup. Pipe from the solution of 2.3 to create a new variable, called <code>LineUp</code> which takes the value ‘Original’ for the years up to and including 1985, and ‘Replacement’ for 1986 onwards</em></p>
<p>Hint: The easiest way to do this will be to use the ifelse() function, which you may not have encountered yet. It requires three arguments - firstly a logical statement, then what value the new variable should take if the statement is true, then the value the new variable should take if the statement is false.</p>
